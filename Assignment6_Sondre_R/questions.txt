1.  The problem with binary is storing decimal numbers, therefore 0.1 + 0.2 would become 0.30000000004, and 0.30000000000004 =/= 0.3
2. the method attribute decided how the form is sent, via GET or POST. a GET sends via a url string and POST sends via the server
3. Because the GET attibute sends via a url string, therefore the url will change
4. Because the frondend is avaliable for everyone who knows html, css and js to read and "change" with f.exmp. dev console, therefore you can prevent malicious input with having a backend form validator 
5. When there is a large amount of text to send, it will be more appropiate to use textarea since the element is scaleable
